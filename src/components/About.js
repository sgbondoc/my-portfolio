            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>Learning motivates me to pursue my passions and how I choose to prioritize my goals. If I can learn something new - I say let's do it!
                Being curious about what I donâ€™t know and continuing to perfect what I do know have led me to a career in software engineering. 
                After extensive experience in ecommerce and merchandising, my inquisitive nature propelled me to explore the technical tools that 
                power the digital platforms I have brought to life for the consumer. I want to continue to learn, grow, and provide exceptional 
                work that provides ease and memorable experiences for the user.
